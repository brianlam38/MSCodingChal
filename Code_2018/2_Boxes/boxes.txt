Contoso Fulfillment, a small logistics startup, is celebrating the 2nd anniversary of the company. The marketing team has decided that all shipments will now use a cylindrical 'anniversary' box to commemorate this milestone. Currently, the fulfillment center has everything packed in rectangular prism boxes or triangular prism boxes. All of the boxes are equilateral at their base and
all of the prism boxes are 12 inches tall. The cylindrical 'anniversary' boxes are 13 inches tall. Given a radius for a cylindrical box, your program should figure out if a given prism box will fit strictly inside of it, and thus ship.
